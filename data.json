In my previous teams, mostly, we used to follow the agile methodology.\r\nCommunication is the cornerstone of the success of a project, as you know.\r\nThis is why I always emphasize the importance of listening carefully to the requirements and details.\r\nWe used to communicate with the teammates using Slack and for project management, we used Jira and Trello.\r\nOutside of work, I enjoy playing football and listening to music.\r\nI find that music is a wonderful creative outlet and stress-reliever, as well as a perfect balance for my demanding career.\r\nThatâ€™s me.\r\nI am ready to get the ball rolling.\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you very soon.\r\nThanks,Steven",
